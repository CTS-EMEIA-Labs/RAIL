# RAIL — Record & Archive Index Ledger

> **Governance of Knowledge Across the Debbaut.Solutions Ecosystem**

RAIL provides a transparent, auditable trail of updates and canonical assets across the
ecosystem of **Debbaut.Solutions**, **ConsultingTeam.Solutions (CTS)**, and **CTS-EMEIA Labs**.

It serves as a **ledger of record** — a minimal, publicly visible index ensuring that the
institutional work of the ecosystem (methodologies, frameworks, and documentation)
remains traceable and timestamped without exposing private content.

### Institutional Memory · Strategic Continuity · Controlled Transparency

RAIL is the **public ledger of structure** for the Debbaut.Solutions ecosystem  
(DS · CTS · CTS-EMEIA Labs).

It is not a product repository.  
It is a **meta-register** — a record of what exists, what changed, and who stewards it.  
Each line is a trace of **governance in action**: documented, timestamped, auditable.

## 🧩 Purpose

- Establish a **single reference point** for ecosystem-wide updates and changelogs.  
- Preserve and demonstrate **continuity and provenance** of ideas, methods, and structural changes  
- Support **auditors, partners, AEO / LLM visibility** through consistent, documented evolution  
- Reflect the principle: *Governance precedes exposure* even fr our own platforms.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `README.md` | Public overview & mission statement (this file) |
| `project-index.md` | Inventory of major ecosystem projects & published assets |
| `changelog.md` | Narrative record of strategic or editorial updates |

RAIL is intentionally minimalist. It contains no client materials, no strategies, no drafts, and no analytics.
