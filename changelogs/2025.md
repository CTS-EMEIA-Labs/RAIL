## 2025-12-17 – AuthorityGrid v1.1.0: Layers + Visibility pivot

- Logged v1.1.0 implementation trace (DEVLOG) and user-facing release notes (CHANGELOG), plus session conversation log for restart-ready handoff.
- Captured migration rules (lane → visibility/overlay), cache alignment notes, and meta box UX simplification outcomes.
- Flagged documentation drift items: remove “lane” framing from legacy project docs; align WP/PHP minimum requirements across public readmes and plugin header.

## 2025-12-11 – UDS Master Architecture & Strategy

- Normalised UDS canonical architecture to eight layers (L0–L7), with L0 Static Prefilter / BBQ Mode explicitly defined and reintroduced wherever it had been omitted.
- Updated all textual references from “seven-layer architecture” to “eight-layer (L0–L7) architecture” across the UDS master.
- Added explicit v1 remediation commitments (minimal core spec, performance budgets, TI baseline, identity hooks, governance defaults, decision trace UI, coexistence archetypes, support playbook).
- Clarified deployment modes (Full, Privacy-Hard, BBQ Emergency, Adapter Fallback) and aligned them with the eight-layer architecture.
- Captured these decisions in ADR-0016 – UDS Eight-Layer Canonical Architecture & v1 Strategic Commitments.

## 2025-12-10 — EF Recovery Guide & Knowledge Rehydration

### Added

- Defined **EF Recovery Guide – Memory, Knowledge & Rehydration** as a formal chapter inside EF, covering:
  - Rehydration scenarios (new project, new thread, new vendor, post-incident recovery).
  - Three-layer packet model: Minimal, Standard, Full.
  - Scenario overlays for DS/CTS doctrine, Banking/WealthTech, and CTS-EMEIA Labs.

- Introduced the **EF Project Scaffold – 10 + 10 + 5** pattern for LLM-facing workspaces:
  - 10 core narrative docs (Execution Framework doctrine, DS/CTS positioning, Labs overview).
  - 10 technical appendices (RAIL index, schema standards, EF-related tooling like UF360/UDS, repo maps).
  - 5 optional data dumps (crawl reports, analytics snapshots, catalogs) used only when relevant.

- Created the concept of **Rehydration Packets** as vendor-neutral, versioned `.md` files to be used when spinning up or reconstructing AI projects.

### Updated

- Clarified EF chapter naming and internal structure in EF Global Master:
  - EF Execution Charter – Master Context  
  - EF Field Manual – Diagnostics & Risk  
  - EF Playbook – Portfolio & Audiences  
  - EF Voice & Branding – Elena & Didier  
  - EF Recovery Guide – Knowledge & Rehydration  

- Reinforced the existing split between:
  - Chat/Projects as **thinking space**,
  - RAIL + Master Files as **record space**,
  - local/cloud as **backup & assets space**,
  now explicitly linked to EF rehydration practices.

### Meta

- **Relates to:** RAIL-#2025.12.10 — EF Recovery Guide & Rehydration Packets  
- **Layer:** Sustain / Knowledge Architecture
