**Task-Force Enterprise doctrinal & AEO alignment**

- Created and finalised TFE as the doctrinal + service page for DS, including TL;DR board brief and refined wording (mandate/device/mechanism).
- Defined TFE as a `DefinedTerm` in EG and added `DefinedTermSet` description for the EG.
- Standardised AEO pattern: added `mentions` references to the TFE glossary term + service page across selected Articles, WebPages, and Service pages (Execution Framework, Execution Forensic Audit, Operational Restructuring, Unified Data Governance, Overreliance on Consulting, FR system d’information centralisé, etc.).
- Clarified page type taxonomy (Article vs WebPage vs Service) for ~15 Task-Force-related URLs to support consistent JSON-LD.
- Added cross-link paragraphs on `/TFE/` URL pointing to related doctrine, diagnostic, and operational restructuring content in both EN and FR.
